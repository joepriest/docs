# Installation

## Requirements
Directus is a forward-looking framework and therefore may not support certain legacy systems. If your server is not compatible with the requirements below, please contact your host to upgrade.

* Apache HTTP Server
* mod_rewrite ([help](/05-troubleshooting/01-faq.md))
* PHP 5.5+
  * curl
  * gd
  * finfo
  * pdo_mysql
  * mcrypt
* MySQL 5.2+

> **Optional Enhancement:** Installing *Imagick* adds thumbnail support for TIFF, PSD, and PDF files

## Server Preparation
1. Check that your server meets the [requirements](/01-getting-started/02-installation.md#requirements)
2. Download and unzip the Directus package from [here](https://github.com/directus/directus/tree/build)
3. Create a database and MySQL user with access/modify privileges on your server
  * You can also use an existing database, but it's worth taking a look at the typical [Directus Schema](/03-developer/06-schema-guide.md)
4. Upload the files to a public directory on your server
5. Run the installation script by accessing the URL where you uploaded the files
